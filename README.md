# Data Structures and Algorithms with Java

This repository contains various **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** implemented using Java, along with conceptual notes to help understand the logic and reasoning behind each implementation.

## Contents

### 1. **Data Structures**
   - Arrays
   - Linked List (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
   - Stacks
   - Queues
   - Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree)
   - Heaps
   - Graphs
   - Hashing (HashMap, HashSet)
   - Tries

### 2. **Algorithms**
   - Sorting (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
   - Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search)
   - Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstraâ€™s, etc.)
   - Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, etc.)
   - Greedy Algorithms
   - Backtracking (N-Queens, Rat in a Maze)
   - Divide and Conquer

## Structure
Each folder contains:
- **Code:** Java implementations for the respective topic.
- **Concept Notes:** Key points and explanations of the underlying concepts.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rudra7009/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Using-Java.git
